5. UPDATE NOTES

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Project-specific notes:

2021-02-08
===================================================================
CO2 measurements from flask-air samples were recalculated onto the 
X2019 CO2 mole fraction scale by first reassigning all standards used 
on the CO2 analysis sytems to X2019. CO2 values on X2019 from air 
samples were caluclated by reprocessing the original raw files (i.e., 
files with raw analyzer output (typically voltages)) with the updated 
assignments for the standards. A detailed description of the scale 
revision from X2007 to X2019 is given in Hall et al. (2020), but the 
main reasons were to correct biases caused by CO2 absorption by 
O-rings in the manometric calibration system and to correct a virial 
coefficient used in the calculation. The magnitiude of the differences 
between X2019 and X2007 varies with CO2 abundance, and is typically 
between 0.1 and 0.2 ppm. Some differences from the late-2000s and 
early-2010s are larger (up to ~0.3 ppm) because of a mis-assigned 
standard on the system used to transfer the scale to working standards.
Measurements prior to ~1980 from early analytical systems (instrument codes 
LR1 and LR2) could not be reprocessed onto X2019; they remain on a CO2 
scale originally developed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.

2020-08-24
===================================================================
The README files were updated to include an 'Introduction' section
with brief explanations of measurement methods and calculations.


2020-06-30
===================================================================
A mistake was discovered in the assigned value of a working tank for
BRW in 2004.  The value was corrected and the data recalculated.
This affected data only from June 3, 2004 to January 12, 2005.


2019-04-16
===================================================================
Measurements of CO2 at Mauna Loa, Hawaii were switched from
a NDIR to a CRDS in June, 2019. Calibration strategy and
measurement frequency changed.

Measurement uncertainty was added to CO2 hourly averages for all sites
for 2019, for BRW and SPO for 2018, and for BRW for 2017.



2017-01-24
===================================================================

The method used to apply flags to the hourly average data was 
changed for the years 1973-2014, to agree with the method used for 
the 2015 and 2016 data.  This means that daily and monthly
averages for those earlier years may have changed by small amounts 
for data packages from previous years.  Hourly values were not affected
by this change, only the flags. See 
https:/www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html
for more details.

===================================================================
2011-10-13

Quasi-continuous CO2 dry air mole fractions from 1980 to 2006 have all 
been recalculated to bring them into the WMO X2007 Mole Fraction 
Scale (X07). The data since 2007 were already on the X07 scale. 
WMO X2007 is based on repeated manometric measurements of the NOAA 
primary standards (Zhao et al. 2006) and comparison of those results 
to similar measurements made over a period of more than 10 years at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  The difference between the X07 
and the previous scales propagated by SIO and NOAA (X83, X87, etc.) 
is ~0.2 ppm (X07-previous) in the 1980s, decreasing to ~0.1 ppm in 
the late 1990s, and to 0.0 ppm by 2006. The recalculation of individual 
measurements was accomplished by first determining the X07 values for 
the reference gases used to measure the air samples and then using those 
values with the raw data (NDIR voltages) to recompute mole fractions
for each sample.

===================================================================
1992-07-22

The types of flags used are currently under review.  Many
flags that were seldom used or were redundant in thier meaning 
will be replaced with more common flags.  The goal is to eventually
have only 8 base flags total; '  ', C, I, V, D, A, DN, and NC.
Any additional flags based on specific selection schemes for each
site will be noted in this file.

===================================================================
1992-07-22

The data selection for Barrow is not consistent for the
data set.  Data starting in 1981 has been given a more rigourous
selection than prior to this date, i.e., there are no D or A 
selection flags before 1981.

The data for Samoa from 1976 through 1987 have had an
additional selection based on wind direction and wind speed. 
(See Waterman et al., 1989).  A 'WD' code stands for data that
has been flagged because the wind direction was not from the clean
air sector.  A 'WS' speed is for data where the wind speed is
below a minimum value.  There are no 'A' flags in the data for
this time period.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6. INTRODUCTION

NOAA GML began continuous measurements of atmospheric CO2
at Barrow, Alaska (BRW) in July, 1973 and at Mauna Loa, Hawaii
(MLO) in April, 1974, at the South Pole in November, 1975 and at American
Samoa in January 1976.  Since the start of these measurements,
our methods have evolved as described below.

Analytical:
The first CO2 measurements at all sites were based on Non-dispersive
Infrared (NDIR) CO2 analyzers (see e.g. Komhyr et al, 1989).
Initially the output from the analyzer was averaged into a single value
per hour, then as two ~20 minute averages per hour in 2014.

Our next-generation analytical systems use laser-based spectrometers
to measure CO2. We began using a new system (off-axis, integrated
cavity output spectroscopy, ICOS) at BRW in April 2013. This system was
operated in parallel with the NDIR system so that comparison measurements
could be made.  In January 2017, the NIDR system was stopped, and the ICOS
system continued as the sole CO2 measurement system.
Data are saved as 10-second averages, which are averaged into "5-minute
averages". Our measurement sequence starts with 210 seconds of
flushing, so only the last 90 seconds (9 10-second averages) are used
to calculate each 5-minute average.  In January of 2018 the data
processing of the South Pole NDIR data was switched to a scheme similar to BRW.
At MLO, we switched to a laser-based, cavity ringdown spectrometer (CRDS)
in June 2019, and now use a similar data processing scheme to BRW.

Calibration:
NDIR systems were first calibrated with two reference gases each hour, then
with three reference gases each hour starting in 1998.  A linear or quadratic
response of the analyzer was determined from these reference gases, and the
mole fraction of the ambient air sample was determined from this response.

For laser-based spectrometers, the analyzer response is calibrated
with a suite of standards every two weeks relative to a reference
gas, and the reference gas is measured hourly to track and
correct short term analyzer drift. As a quality assurance step, a
well-calibrated "target" gas is measured up to twice per day.
For the SPO NDIR starting in January 2018, the analyzer response is
calibrated with a suite of 4 standards twice a day relative to a reference
gas. The reference gas is measured twice an hour to track and
correct short term analyzer drift.

NOAA carbon dioxide measurements are reported on the WMO X2019
CO2 standard scale.
(https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccl/co2_scale.html).

Quality control:
All measurements are inspected manually to determine periods
when the analytical instrument was not working optimally. Automated
algorithms have been recently introduced to assist in the determination
of these periods.

Hourly averages:
Starting in about 1986 (depending on site), minute average or 10 second
average values of the analyzer output are recorded, and an hourly average
and standard deviation of the ambient mole fraction CO2 is calculated
(prior to about 1986, the standard deviation was not available).
The value_std_dev takes into account the analyzer standard deviation, so
normally it is not 0 even if nvalue=1.  A value_std_dev value of 0.0 or -99.99
would indicate times when the analyzer output standard deviation for the hour
is not available.

For spectrometer systems and for the SPO NDIR system starting in
January 2018, 5-minute averages are used to calculate hourly averages,
but value_std_dev includes variability in the 5-min averages, so it is
greater than the normal sample SD of the 5-min averages that go into the
hourly mean, and when nvalue=1 (i.e., one 5-min average in the hourly mean),
value_std_dev is still calculated and reported.

Selection for background:
Valid hourly averaged data are selected to distinguish samples of
regionally representative air (background) from samples influenced
by local sources and sinks (non-background). Background hourly
data are identified where the first two characters are ".." for the selection
flag.  A couple selection steps are conducted, involving withing hour
variability and hour to hour changes.  For SMO and SPO, wind direction
is also included as a selection criteria.  For MLO, data during prevalent
upslope hours of the day are flagged with a '.U.' flag, due to depeletion
of CO2 by local vegetation nearby.  See also section 7.5

Uncertainties:
Measurement uncertainty (value_unc) was added to CO2 hourly averages for all
sites for 2019, for BRW and SPO for 2018, and for BRW for 2017.
The uncertainty is based on analytical repeatability and reproducibility,
and our ability to propagate the WMO CO2 mole fraction standard scale.
Repeatability is based on the stability of reference gas measurements, and
reproducibility is based on long term measurements of a known 'target' gas.
The scale propagation term is based on the uncertainty we assign to standards,
0.03 ppm. All terms are given as 68% confidence intervals. Although we still
list "value_std_dev" of hourly averages (standard deviation of values that
go into an hourly average as described above, which includes natural
variability and measurement uncertainty), we now list measurement uncertainty
as a separate term.  Total uncertainty is calculated by adding the individual
terms in quadrature (square root of the sum of the squares).

7.3 DATA - FILE TYPE

We now provide some NOAA Global Monitoring Laboratory measurements
in two unique file formats (netCDF and ASCII text). The Network
Common Data Form (NetCDF) is a self-describing, machine-independent
data format that supports creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented
scientific data.  To learn more about netCDF and how to read netCDF
files, please visit http://www.unidata.ucar.edu. 

The ASCII text file is derived directly from the netCDF file.  The
text file is also self-describing and can be viewed using any text
editor.  "Self-describing" means the file includes enough information
about the included data (called metadata) that no additional file is 
required to understand the structure of the data and how to read and 
use the data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.4 DATA - CONTENT

For each observatory record we provide an hourly, daily, and monthly
average file.  Daily averages are derived directly from the hourly data.
Monthly averages are derived from the daily averages.  Higher resolution
data (sub-hourly) are available upon request.


All (ASCII text and netCDF) files are located in 
"ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/data/trace_gases/co2/in-situ/surface/[site]/".

Files are named as follows (see Section 7.2 for details):

     co2_[site]_surface-insitu_1_ccgg_HourlyData.[file type]
     co2_[site]_surface-insitu_1_ccgg_DailyData.[file type]
     co2_[site]_surface-insitu_1_ccgg_MonthlyData.[filetype]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.5 QC FLAGS

NOAA GML uses a 3-column quality control flag where each column
is defined as follows:

column 1    REJECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other
            than a period (.) in the FIRST column indicates
            a sample with obvious problems during collection
            or analysis.  This measurement should not be interpreted.

column 2    SELECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a
            period (.) in the SECOND column indicates a sample
            that is likely valid but does not meet selection
            criteria determined by the goals of a particular
            investigation.

column 3    INFORMATION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a period (.) 
            in the THIRD column provides additional information 
            about the collection or analysis of the sample.

            WARNING: A "P" in the 3rd column of the QC flag indicates
            the measurement result is preliminary and has not yet been 
            carefully examined by the PI.  The "P" flag is removed once 
            the quality of the measurement has been assessed.

SUMMARY OF SELECTION FLAGS

Missing data will have a value of -999.99 for the mole fraction.
Times are specified in Greenwich Mean Time. Hours are specified
as the beginning of the hour, for example, hour 5 corresponds to
5 AM to 6 AM GMT.

The selection process is done to distinguish "background" mole
fractions, that is, the values that we believe are not contaminated
by local sources or sinks of CO2.  The selection process depends
on the station (see references).  The selection code is a three
character code, where the first character indicates missing data or
instrumental problems, the second character indicates selection due 
to non-background criteria. The third character is not used for
data selection. The available codes are:

   ... - No code applied. Data are considered 'background'
   *.. - Unable to compute a mole fraction or average
   I.. - No data available due to instrument calibration or malfunction.
   .V. - Large variability of CO2 mole fraction within one hour
   .D. - Hour-to-hour difference in mole fraction > 0.25 ppm
   .U. - Rejected, diurnal variation (upslope) in CO2 (Mauna Loa only)
   .S. - Single hour bracketed by flagged data.
   .N. - No unflagged data within +/- 8 hours. Assume non-background.
   .W. - Wind direction out of clean air sector. Assume non-background.


Missing data will have a value of -999.99 for the hour, and "background" 
values will be designated by a '.' character for the first two characters.
See also the 'Update_notes' file for information regarding other codes.
